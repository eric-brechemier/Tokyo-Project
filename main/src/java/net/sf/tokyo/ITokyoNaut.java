/**
 * ITokyoNaut is the single interface making up Tokyo API, 
 * allowing both XML and non-XML data transformations.<br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * The name "TokyoNaut" is composed of "Tokyo", a mind-changing city where this project started,
 * while "Naut" is a shorthand reference to Nautilus, Captain Nemo's submarine in Jules Verne's
 * "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea".
 * More inspiration comes from Captain Nemo's motto: "Mobilis in Mobili".
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Methods available() and read() are similar to same methods in InputStream, but the intention
 * is to get nodes one by one, with available() returning the number of bytes of current node,
 * and read() writing the bytes representing the node, starting with 0x00 to mark the node start
 * (Push on stack), one byte to identify the node type, all the bytes corresponding to the node 
 * content, including child nodes, and ending with 0xFF to mark the node end (Pop from stack).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Plug and unplug allow to initialize a chain of collaborating TokyoNauts, and unchain them
 * to let them free any allocated ressources at the end of the processing.
 * </p>
