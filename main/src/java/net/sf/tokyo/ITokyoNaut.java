/**
 * ITokyoNaut is the single interface making up Tokyo API, 
 * allowing both XML and non-XML data transformations.<br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * The name "TokyoNaut" is composed of "Tokyo", a mind-changing city where this project started,
 * while "Naut" is a shorthand reference to Nautilus, Captain Nemo's submarine in Jules Verne's
 * "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea".
 * More inspiration comes from Captain Nemo's motto: "Mobilis in Mobili".
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Methods inTouch() and read() are called in turn to check whether data is available for reading,
 * and then have meta and data buffers filled by reading TokyoNaut's writing.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Plug and unplug allow to initialize a chain of collaborating TokyoNauts, and unchain them
 * to let them free any allocated ressources at the end of the processing.
 * </p>
