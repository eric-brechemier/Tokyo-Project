/**
 * ITokyoNaut is the one single interface making up Tokyo API.<br/>
 *
 * <p>
 * The name "TokyoNaut" is composed of "Tokyo" which inspired this project, while "Naut" is a shorthand 
 * for Nautilus, Captain Nemo's submarine in "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" by Jules Verne. 
 * Captain Nemo's motto, "Mobilis in Mobili", fits well with this flexible data navigation API.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * TokyoNaut instances (classes that implement the ITokyoNaut interface) are expected to be stateless. 
 * Each call of "morph" is intended to rewrite the input data by interpreting a set of instructions 
 * or "rules", one step at a time, and updating the associated state for use in following runs. 
 * While "morph" modifies the data, the state, and even possibly the rules, "remain" is read only and 
 * returns an integer value giving an (optimistic) assessment of remaining steps.
 * </p>
