/**
 * SAX Filter - Very similar to org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLFilterImpl,
 * with addtional logging of all events and LexicalHandler filtering.
 *
 * <p>XMLReader is the interface that an XML parser's SAX2 driver must
 * implement.  This interface allows an application to set and
 * query features and properties in the parser, to register
 * event handlers for document processing, and to initiate
 * a document parse.</p>
 *
 * <p>All SAX interfaces are assumed to be synchronous: the
 * {@link #parse parse} methods must not return until parsing
 * is complete, and readers must wait for an event-handler callback
 * to return before reporting the next event.</p>
 *
 * <p>This interface replaces the (now deprecated) SAX 1.0 {@link
 * org.xml.sax.Parser Parser} interface.  The XMLReader interface
 * contains two important enhancements over the old Parser
 * interface:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>it adds a standard way to query and set features and 
 *  properties; and</li>
 * <li>it adds Namespace support, which is required for many
 *  higher-level XML standards.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>There are adapters available to convert a SAX1 Parser to
 * a SAX2 XMLReader and vice-versa.</p>

   *
   * <p>The reporting of parameter entities (including
   * the external DTD subset) is optional, and SAX2 drivers that
   * report LexicalHandler events may not implement it; you can use the
   * <code
   * >http://xml.org/sax/features/lexical-handler/parameter-entities</code>
   * feature to query or control the reporting of parameter entities.</p>
   *
   * <p>General entities are reported with their regular names,
   * parameter entities have '%' prepended to their names, and 
   * the external DTD subset has the pseudo-entity name "[dtd]".</p>
   *
   * <p>When a SAX2 driver is providing these events, all other 
   * events must be properly nested within start/end entity 
   * events.  There is no additional requirement that events from 
   * {@link org.xml.sax.ext.DeclHandler DeclHandler} or
   * {@link org.xml.sax.DTDHandler DTDHandler} be properly ordered.</p>
   *
   * <p>Note that skipped entities will be reported through the
   * {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#skippedEntity skippedEntity}
   * event, which is part of the ContentHandler interface.</p>
   *
   * <p>Because of the streaming event model that SAX uses, some
   * entity boundaries cannot be reported under any 
   * circumstances:</p>
   *
   * <ul>
   * <li>general entities within attribute values</li>
   * <li>parameter entities within declarations</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>These will be silently expanded, with no indication of where
   * the original entity boundaries were.</p>
   *
   * <p>Note also that the boundaries of character references (which
   * are not really entities anyway) are not reported.</p>
   *
   * <p>All start/endEntity events must be properly nested.
   *
   * @param name The name of the entity.  If it is a parameter
   *        entity, the name will begin with '%', and if it is the
   *        external DTD subset, it will be "[dtd]".
   * @exception SAXException The application may raise an exception.
