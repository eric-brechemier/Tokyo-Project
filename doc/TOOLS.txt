                        **       Tokyo Project       **
                        **      Tools Definition     **
                        *******************************


This documents defines the different tools to be implemented to demonstrate our process and 
architecture with the sample use cases. Tools will be developped in Java J2SE.

This list is not exhaustive, additional tools may be added later according to needs.
Unnecessary tools won't be developped (e.g. already existing ones).


For prototype
**************
- a specific implementation of XML Pull Parser and Serializer APIs on some non-XML data
- adapters needed from this API to APIs expected by Saxon XSLT processor
- some XSLT stylesheets to process the non-XML data viewed as XML
- some (other) XSLT stylesheets to process XML data and output it (in XML mode) as non-XML

For other samples
*****************
- based on grammar definition files,
  * validation / inspection tools (for unit test / debugging)
      NOTA: a reference application should be chosen (when available) for data viewing
  * parser / serializer implemented using the simplest of solutions below
    - specific implementation (hand-coded)
    - specific implementation (code generated from grammar definition)
    - generic tool using grammar file as a configuration to process non-XML data

Samples themselves (quoted from ROADMAP)
****************************************

  * view mails in mbox file (read)
      sort mail by date and thread (sender/receiver)
      generate html pages showing highlighted mail content
      
  * PDF, Word, Excel output (write)
      output documents that can be printed nicely
      from source xml data
  
  * source code analysis (read)
      process source code and output simple analysis (number of lines/method, comments...)
