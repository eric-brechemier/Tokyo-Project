                        *******************************


* OBJECTIVES
- provide an XML view of non-XML data
- let applications view and create non-XML documents as easily as XML ones
- transformation of non-XML documents to XML and back again

* VISION
- we start with:
    - on the one hand, lots of existing applications working on xml data,
      lots of developers with experience in xml processing,
    - on the other hand, many remaining non-xml formats
      (e.g. for pure binary or pure text data)

- handling non-XML data as XML requires two transformations:
    - from non-xml to xml, for applications input,
    corresponding to XML parsing
    - from xml to non-xml, for applications output,
    corresponding to XML serializing

- an XML parser works on standard XML files/data and implements some XML Parser API (DOM, SAX,...)
  Applications do not access XML data directly, but through the provided API
  
- an XML serializer implements some XML Serializer API (DOM,...).
  Applications often do not create XML data directly, but through the provided API.
  Some applications create XML data directly - this data will have to be converted in a second step.
    
- the structure of an XML document is explicit, it uses the same syntax for all XML documents,
  no matter which grammar/vocabulary they use. Parsers can process this data without any knowledge
  of the document semantics.
  Structure in non-XML data is often implicit or uses a very specific syntax.
  Applications often need to know some grammar to be able to parse the data.

- the first step of the process is formalizing the grammar of your data.
  This definition may be done with different notations (EBNF, tables, encoding algorithm,...).
  It should contain:
    - some structure, which will be mapped to the XML tree structure
    - some codecs, defining the format of leaf nodes
    - some comments, explaining the semantics of different fields
    - there may also be some additional relations between different elements,
    that must be understood for proper decoding (choice, repeat, based on values read before)
  This project may end up defining a general format good enough for 80% of grammar definitions,
  or using different grammar types for different formats.
  
* IN A NUTSHELL
- define the grammar of your data
- define the vocabulary for your data viewed as XML
- define the syntax of your queries, e.g. the required XPath subset
- use them to create 
    - one tool reading your data and implementing an XML parsing API,
      with the following possible components:
      * Query parsing and analysis
      * State Machine for Data Grammar
      * State Machine/Factory for Data Extraction
      
    - one tool providing an XML serializing API and writing your data,
      with the following possible components:
      * Query parsing and analysis
      * State Machine for Data Grammar
      * State Machine/Factory for Data Serialization
    
    - and maybe additional tools to validate input data / generated data
    
- plug your tool on applications processing XML

NOTE:
    - you may need some adapters for the expected API or extra conversion steps
    - the application has to know the vocabulary of your data viewed as XML 
      to understand its semantic
