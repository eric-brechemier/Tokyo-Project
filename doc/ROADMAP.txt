                        ** ROADMAP for Tokyo Project **
                        *******************************

Objectives:
  * design a process
  * design an architecture
  * design tools
  
Sample Applications:
  * view mails in mbox file (read)
      sort mail by date and thread (sender/receiver)
      generate html pages showing highlighted mail content
      
  * PDF, Word, Excel output (write)
      output documents that can be printed nicely
      from source xml data
  
  * source code analysis (read)
      process source code and output simple analysis (number of lines/method, comments...)
 
****************************** 
 Project Status / Milestones
******************************

  * 1-Planning [July 28th-August 15th 2005]
      Roadmap complete with code names for expected releases           - target: 2005-08-01
      Informal (text file) process definition                          - target: 2005-08-01
      Informal (text file) architecture definition                     - target: 2005-08-01
      Informal (text file) tools definition                            - target: 2005-08-01
  
  => First release "Chiyoda-ku" 0.1    - target: 2005-08-01
  
  Before Pre-alpha
    Prototype:                                                         - target: 2005-08-15
      implement xmlpull.org pull api with parser on simple line reader in text file
      (add fixed elements file for root and line for each line, 
       put text value either as attribute or simple content)
    
      find or write wrapper for API expected by Saxon (sTrax?)
      test xslt transformation on text file viewed as XML file
  
  => release "Akihabara" 0.2   - target: 2005-08-15
  

  
  * 2-Pre-Alpha [August 16th-31st 2005]
      
    Project structure (compiling, unit tests, distribution)          - target: 2005-08-31
    Help file for project configuration (Tools/Libraries needed)     - target: 2005-08-31
    HTML+PNG document for project presentation (vision document)     - target: 2005-08-31
    HTML+PNG document for roadmap                                    - target: 2005-08-31
    HTML+PNG document for process definition                         - target: 2005-08-31
    HTML+PNG document for architecture definition                    - target: 2005-08-31
    HTML+PNG document for tools definition                           - target: 2005-08-31
    
    First sample: reading mbox mail files and output xhtml for viewing - target: 2005-08-31
    The simplest architecture that may possibly work for first example - target: 2005-08-31
  
  => release "Chuo-ku" 0.3   - target: 2005-08-31
  

  
  * 3-Alpha [September 1st-November 15th 2005]
    
    Second sample (output PDF, Word, Excel), simple implementation
    Extend grammar as required to deal with more file formats
    Formal document describing grammar definition
    
  => release "Asakusa" 0.4   - target: 2005-09-30
  
    Third sample, simple implementation of source code analysis.
    
  => release "Ikebukuro" 0.5   - target: 2005-11-15
  
  
  
  * 4-Beta [November 15th-February 13th 2005]

  Different iterations based on comments - target: 2005-12 to Q1 2006
  => release "Roppongi" 0.6
  => release "Ebisu" 0.7
  => release "Shibuya" 0.8
