                        ** ROADMAP for Tokyo Project **
                        *******************************

Objectives:
  * design a process
  * design an architecture
  * design tools
  * design a data manipulation API
  * a very simple document to present previous points
  
Sample Applications:
  * prototype application (read|write)
      order custom CSV data on countries
  
  * view mails in mbox file (read)
      sort mail by date and thread (sender/receiver)
      generate html pages showing highlighted mail content
      
  * PDF, Word, Excel output (write)
      output documents that can be printed nicely
      from source xml data
  
  * source code analysis (read)
      process source code and output simple analysis (number of lines/method, comments...)

Additional projects to be based on designed API:
  * XSLT Chess Game reading/writing standard chess notation files
  * Interpreter Engine for Simple Games

 Project Status / Milestones
******************************

  * 1-Planning [July 28th-August 15th 2005]
      Roadmap complete with code names for expected releases
      Informal (text file) process definition
      Informal (text file) architecture definition
      Informal (text file) tools definition
  => RELEASED: 2005-08-01
     First release "Chiyoda-ku" 0.1 
     
  Before Pre-alpha
    Prototype:
      -implement xmlpull.org pull api with parser on simple line reader in text file
      (add fixed elements file for root and line for each line, 
       put text value either as attribute or simple content)
      -find or write wrapper for API expected by Saxon (SAX1/SAX2)
      test xslt transformation on text file viewed as XML file
  => RELEASED: 2005-08-15
     release "Akihabara" 0.2
  
  
  * 2-Pre-Alpha [August 16th 2005-May 31st 2006]
    Research by reading reference books in compiling and linguistics:
      - Compilers, Principles, Techniques and Tools, Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, Jeffrey D. Ullman, 2003
        [ISBN: 0201101947]
      - Compilateurs, Dick Grune, Henri E. Bal, Ceriel J.H. Jacobs, Koen G. Langendoen, 2002

      - Relevance, communication & cognition (second edition), Dan Sperber, Deirdre Wilson, 1995
        [ISBN : 0631198784]
    Updated Prototype:
      -based on custom API (Nautilus API) designed for simplicity,
       from both user and implementer perspective
      -actual processing (parsing/writing) based on a set of rules describing format
  => release "Chuo-ku" 0.3                                            - target: 2006-05-18
    
    Second Prototype:
      -browse PDF file structure using Nautilus API
      (with simplest of either mapping external tool or using own format description rules)
  => release "Asakusa" 0.4                                            - target: 2006-05-31
  
  
  * 3-Alpha [June 1st 2006-September 31st 2006]
    Project structure (compiling, unit tests, distribution)            - target: 2006-06-07
    The simplest architecture that may possibly work for first sample  - target: 2006-06-14
    First sample: reading mbox mail files and output xhtml for viewing - target: 2006-06-14
