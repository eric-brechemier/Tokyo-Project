                        *******************************   
                        ** ROADMAP for Tokyo Project **
                        *******************************

Objectives:
  * design a process
  * design an architecture
  * design tools
  * design a data manipulation API
  * a very simple document to present previous points
  
Sample Applications:
  * prototype application (read|write)
      order custom CSV data on countries
  
  * view mails in mbox file (read)
      sort mail by date and thread (sender/receiver)
      generate html pages showing highlighted mail content
      
  * PDF, Word, Excel output (write)
      output documents that can be printed nicely
      from source xml data
  
  * source code analysis (read)
      process source code and output simple analysis (number of lines/method, comments...)

Additional projects to be based on designed API:
  * Interpreter Engine for Simple Games

****************************** 
 Project Status / Milestones
******************************

Current Tasks:
  * Research, reading about compiling and linguistics
  * API Update
  * Prototype Update

Past Milestones:
  => Tokyo Project "Chiyoda-ku" release (0.1)
  RELEASED: 2005-08-01
  Phase: 1-Planning
  Content:
    Chiyoda-ku is the first release of Tokyo Project, corresponding to version 0.1. 
    It includes a roadmap and informal definitions of process, architecture, and tools 
    to fulfill the project goal: providing an XML view of non-XML data.
     
  => Tokyo Project "Akihabara" release (0.2)
  RELEASED: 2005-08-15
  Phase: 2-Pre-Alpha
  Content:
    The Akihabara release is the official pre-alpha release of Tokyo Project 
    (the goal of Tokyo Project is to design a process, an architecture, and tools 
     to provide an XML view of non-XML data). 
    This release includes a Java/XSLT prototype transforming custom text data into custom text data 
    using XSLT to reorder this data, AS IF it was merely XML. 
    Prototyping phase ended successfully prior to this release, demonstrating that the process defined 
    as part of Tokyo Project allows Text-to-Text conversion. Besides, no major issue appeared during 
    this experimentation as for Binary-to-Binary conversion, which will be demonstrated during a
    following phase of Tokyo Project.
    
  => Tokyo Project "Shibuya" release (0.3)
  RELEASED: 2006-11-24
  Phase: 2-Pre-Alpha
  Content:
    Shibuya is an important step in Tokyo Project, with the release of a new API at its core,
    the TokyoNautilus API. This release includes updated project documentation and roadmap, 
    as well as a new prototype demonstrating how the API can help to manipulate CSV data 
    using XSLT as if it was XML.
    
Next Milestone:
  => Tokyo Project "Harajuku" release (0.4)
  TARGET: December 2007
  Phase: 3-Alpha
  Content:
    New Tokyo API demonstrating atomic annotations performed by different TokyoNauts.
    Extended prototype using external configuration file (XML) instead of hard-coded rules (Java code)
    for CSV translation to and from SAX events.
  
  => Tokyo Project "Roppongi" release (0.5)
  TARGET: January 2008
  Phase: 3-Alpha
    HTML Documentation for project, to be displayed on Sourceforge Project Home Page.
    Documentation will include
      - Project presentation (Context, License, API, Architecture, Process, Tools, and Roadmap)
      - API Documentation (Javadoc)
      - Links to project SVN and files download
  
  => Tokyo Project "Shinjuku" release (0.6)
  TARGET: March 2008
  Phase: 3-Alpha
    Browse PDF file structure using TokyoNautilus API;
    implementation will either use a custom implementation based on a partial grammar definition file 
    for PDF, or some external tool providing PDF parsing functionalities.
  
  => Tokyo Project "Ebisu" release (0.7)
  TARGET: June 2008
  Phase: 3-Alpha
  Content:
    First sample: reading mbox mail files and output xhtml for viewing
  
  => Tokyo Project "Ikebukuro" release (0.7.5)
  TARGET: September 2008
  Phase: 3-Alpha
  Content:
    Second sample: output PDF files from XML descriptions 
  
  => Tokyo Project "Takadanobaba" release (0.8)
  TARGET: November 2008
  Phase: 4-Beta
  Content:
    Third sample: simple implementation of source code analysis
  
  => Tokyo Project "Ueno" release (0.8)
  TARGET: December 2008
  Phase: 4-Beta
  Content:
    More robust implementations for three samples
    
  => Tokyo Project "Nihombashi", "Marunouchi", "Ochanomizu",... releases (0.9.x)
  TARGET: 2009
  Phase: 4-Beta
  Content:
    Series of updates based on collected comments/feedback.
  
  => Tokyo Project "Ginza" release (1.0)
  TARGET: 2009
  Phase: 5-Production/Stable
  Content:  
    Substantial feedback received, 
    no severe bug open, less than 3 minor bugs open, few new bugs every week.
