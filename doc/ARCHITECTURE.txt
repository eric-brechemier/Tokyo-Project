                        **  Architecture Definition  **
                        *******************************

* OBJECTIVES
- provide an XML view of non-XML data
- let applications view and create non-XML documents as easily as XML ones
- transformation of non-XML documents to XML and back again

* VISION
- the adaptation of a specific data format can be done by writing custom code by hand, which 
could be the easiest approach for a programmer, or by writing some configuration file instead 
to automate the transformation process. This could be as complex as the EBNF of the data format 
grammar, or as simple as a property file or tasks described in XML a la Apache Ant.

- different architectures can be defined to implement the proposed process:
    - using the formalized grammar as a basis for the development of data-to-xml
    and xml-to-data processors
    - generating the code of those processors from grammar files
    - using generic tools taking the grammar file as a configuration 
    that enables them to read and write data in corresponding format

- we have to choose an XML parser API and an XML serializer API to be implemented
  by our non-XML data processors.
  I chose at first the API defined by xmlpull.org. The main advantages of Pull API are:
    * it is both very usable and efficient
    * adapters can be implemented simply for both SAX and DOM APIs
  However, its main disadvantages are:
    * there are too many (xml specific) methods to be implemented for custom data parsing
    * the serializing API is (too) different from the parsing API
  Therefore, I ended designing a new simple API as part of this project, 
  and I coined this Tokyo Project API "TokyoNautilus", a strange combination in reference
  to Jules Verne's "Mobilis in Mobili" and a strong attraction for Japan.
  
- the basic architecture is:

For Parsing
non-XML data 
 -> [non-XML Parser] 
    -> [TokyoNautilus API] 
       -> [XML API Adaptor] 
           -> [XML Application]
e.g.
CSV 
  -> CSV parser 
     -> TokyoNautilus API 
        -> SAX API Adaptor 
            -> XSLT Processor

For Serializing
[XML Application] 
  -> [XML Serializer Adaptor] 
      -> [TokyoNautilus API] 
         -> [non-XML Serializer] 
            -> non-XML data
e.g.
XSLT Processor 
  -> DOM API 
     -> TokyoNautilus API 
        -> CSV Serializer 
           -> CSV




* IN A NUTSHELL

In order to benefit from TokyoNautilus for a new non-xml data format, the following steps are required:

- implement TokyoNautilus API for your non-XML data parsing/serializing, 
taking advantage if possible of existing tools and the formal grammar definition of your data

- implement adapters of TokyoNautilus API to XML APIs needed by your application
(this part is largely independent of your data format)
