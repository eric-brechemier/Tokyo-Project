*** Tokyo Project ***

XML has now been widely adopted as a standard for storage, exchange and representation of structured information.

XML is a good compromise between (human) readability and efficient (machine) processing, but it is still not good enough for many uses that do not allow any concession.
Two common examples are programming and databases. For the former, full text is used because no compromise on source code readability is acceptable, for the latter data is stored as binary because no compromise on processing efficiency is acceptable.

The goal of the Tokyo Project is to design a process, an architecture, and tools to provide an XML view of non-XML data. This way, applications can view and create non-XML documents as easily as XML ones.

A simple business case is the transformation of non-XML documents to XML and back again (anything-to-xml-to-anything). Therefore, this project may also prove useful to manage binary documents created by commercial applications, as long as their file format is available.

The Tokyo Project is hosted on Sourceforge:
